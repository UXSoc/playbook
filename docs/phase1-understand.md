The exercises in this phase help us understand and empathize with the users'
life (consumer software) or work (business software) needs.

Throughout the phase, people take notes, often on sticky notes that they stick
to the walls of the room.

We start with "pitch practice", where the client pitches their product like they
would to investors. This helps us identify the user, their problem, and the job
they are hiring the product to do. It also begins documenting the [vocabulary
used in the domain](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html).

We then review research from Quora, Analytics, AdWords Keyword Planner,
interviews, and surveys. This helps us understand users' motivation, the
marketing funnel, and the size of target markets.

Lastly, we sketch what the rest of the sprint will focus on: the critical path
for the software. At this point, we try to keep this high-level and as light on
implementation details as possible. A great question to help generate the
critical path is:

> What job is the user hiring the product to do?

We will edit the critical path as we move through the phases.
