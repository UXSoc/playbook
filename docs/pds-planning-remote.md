Remote work is when the client and the team are in different locations, either
the team is in another thoughtbot office from the client or team members work
from a different location for the duration of the project.

Meet in person
--------------

At the beginning of a remote engagement, when possible, everyone should meet in
person for at least one work week. This is useful in order to get to know the
team members better and to develop relationships, which will make it easier to
communicate through asynchronous channels in the future.

If possible, it is beneficial to meet in person again throughout the project.

Well-defined roles and workflows
--------------------------------

At the beginning of the project define who handles which role, and how to
communicate amongst the team. For example, decide whether standups will be done
via group chat messages or via voice or video call.

If part of the team is remote, the whole team should work as if it were remote.
We should over-communicate. Major decisions regarding the project must be
documented online in a medium everyone is aware of and able to contribute to.
This means that all project-related communication should be done in asynchronous
channels that we already use, such as GitHub, Trello, Basecamp, and Slack. The
only workflow difference using these tools when doing remote work is that we
communicate all important information asynchronously, so that everyone stays
informed.

In person communication during a project usually includes frequent updates on
current work and various social interactions. The chat room should be the space
where we communicate, so that no one feels left out, especially team members who
work remotely.

Team members should also be conscious that asynchronous communication means that
sometimes the other person is not immediately available to respond, and not
expect them to. Furthermore, online communication lacks the non-verbal visual
cues such as voice tone and inflection, facial expressions, and body language.
We should be more careful in the language that we choose to use. A good
reference is [our existing code review guide](https://tbot.io/code-review).

Feeling isolated
----------------

When working remotely, especially when alone, it is easy to forget how it feels
to be immersed in team camaraderie. Video conferencing helps alleviate this
feeling as well as occasional visits to the office, or working from a co-working
space.

Work hours
----------

We should try to have 4-6 hours (with consideration of time differences) in the
work day that overlap between locations to allow for synchronous communication.

For some people, it is sometimes difficult to disengage from work when working
at home. Also, flexible hours means that sometime one may work non-traditional
hours in the day. We should be conscious to keep to a sustainable pace and take
a break away from work.

Tools
-----

Good tools for remote [pair programming](/#pair-programming) are:

*   [tmate](https://tmate.io/) and Vim or Emacs, since they require very little
    bandwidth and do not lag. Another channel will be needed for voice/video
communication, such as a Hangout or Skype.
*   [Screen sharing in Slack](https://tbot.io/slack-screen-sharing) when you
    need access to other software like the web browser.
